## Tips

My distro was built in Arch Linux using Linux zen kernel, if you have another kernel you can use this file but check my /autoscripts dir wich have some scripts I needed to make this thing works, also I have a "minimalistic" desktop so, if you want to move on it you have to use the keyboard, mine uses "Ã±" so the layout is "latam" you may have to change it
