# Dotfiles

## Tips

My distro was built in Arch Linux using Linux zen kernel, if you have another kernel you can use these files, but check my ./.config/bspwmrc file wich have some scripts at the bottom you may not need to make yours work, also I have a "minimalistic" desktop so, if you want to move on it you have to use the keyboard, mine uses "Ã±" so the layout is "latam" you may have to change it at bspwmrc file

Note: I'm switch from Tilix to Alacritty I found it faster, I implemented picom and I'm loading a new color schema, if you are using tilix you can check previous versions of this repository, you may find something useful

## To do:

- Switch to another WM or something
